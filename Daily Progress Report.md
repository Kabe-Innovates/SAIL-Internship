## Day 1 - (01 / 01 / 2026)
- I completed the joining formalities by meeting the designated in-charges and applied for my Gate Pass.

## Day 2 - (02 / 01 / 2026)
- At first, I collected my Gate Pass from the Pass Section, entered the HRDC department, and registered my attendance.
- I collected a helmet to ensure my safety during the plant visit.
- First, I went to meet Saravana Pandiyan Sir and introduced myself.
- He welcomed me and guided me kindly. He gave me clarity on what I am going to do in this internship and what I am going to learn.
- Then, he suggested I visit the industry, as it might eventually help me understand what the company is doing.
- Even though I am a C & IT Intern, an industry visit will help me understand how and why specific tasks are done in the C & IT department.
- I personally feel the Industry Visit will help me understand those "black boxes."
- In my hands, I held my Gate Pass, MEMO, and the most important thing—the Training Schedule.
- Just out of curiosity, I read the schedule and felt overwhelmed; most of the terms were new to me. However, it is good to be grounded and realize there are still things to learn.
- When I first entered the STEEL PLANT, I thought the concepts would be basic and that I would already know all the stuff they teach. But that Training Schedule grounded me. I personally feel that this realization was a good one, as it will enable me to learn a lot.
- Then, I went to the Safety Engineering Department. This place actually gave me the plan for what to do on Day 3.
- They instructed me on the safety principles to follow, what they do in the Steel Plant, and gave an overview of different sectors (HRM, CRM, SMS). The video they showed made me want to visit the factory instantly, but because I ran out of time, I had to postpone it to the next day.
- So, the plan for Day 3 is to visit the HRM and CRM (Hot and Cold Rolling Mills). I am so eager to see how steel undergoes processing to become a finished product.
