## Day 1 - (01 / 01 / 2026)
- I completed the joining formalities by meeting the designated in-charges and applied for my Gate Pass.

## Day 2 - (02 / 01 / 2026)
- At first, I collected my Gate Pass from the Pass Section, entered the HRDC department, and registered my attendance.
- I collected a helmet to ensure my safety during the plant visit.
- First, I went to meet Saravana Pandiyan Sir and introduced myself.
- He welcomed me and guided me kindly. He gave me clarity on what I am going to do in this internship and what I am going to learn.
- Then, he suggested I visit the industry, as it might eventually help me understand what the company is doing.
- Even though I am a C & IT Intern, an industry visit will help me understand how and why specific tasks are done in the C & IT department.
- I personally feel the Industry Visit will help me understand those "black boxes."
- In my hands, I held my Gate Pass, MEMO, and the most important thing—the Training Schedule.
- Just out of curiosity, I read the schedule and felt overwhelmed; most of the terms were new to me. However, it is good to be grounded and realize there are still things to learn.
- When I first entered the STEEL PLANT, I thought the concepts would be basic and that I would already know all the stuff they teach. But that Training Schedule grounded me. I personally feel that this realization was a good one, as it will enable me to learn a lot.
- Then, I went to the Safety Engineering Department. This place actually gave me the plan for what to do on Day 3.
- They instructed me on the safety principles to follow, what they do in the Steel Plant, and gave an overview of different sectors (HRM, CRM, SMS). The video they showed made me want to visit the factory instantly, but because I ran out of time, I had to postpone it to the next day.
- So, the plan for Day 3 is to visit the HRM and CRM (Hot and Cold Rolling Mills). I am so eager to see how steel undergoes processing to become a finished product.

## Day 3 - (03 / 01 / 2026)
- On the actual day of the planned visit, I really couldn't believe my eyes.
- The machines were so big. I went blank once I entered the HRM. Even though the Safety Engineering department guided me well, I was blank on whom to ask about these enormous machines, what they did, and a lot more.
- At first, I saw a banner which explained the complete workflow of this HRM, starting from the Slab Yard.
- I saw a few slabs which were huge in size, likely weighing several tons. At first, they were a dull white color before being loaded into the furnace. The autonomous movement of the slabs grabbed my attention. While the slab was being loaded, from a particular view, I was able to see the complete furnace.
- It was loaded with 3–4 slabs at a time, and the temperature must have been very high. For the first time in my life, I saw the color of LAVA in reality.
- I searched for some officials to interact with, but they were busy working, so I didn't want to interrupt them. I waited for a while, and suddenly, that moment came.
- A huge, hot slab came out of the furnace; the luminosity of the slab was an unforgettable experience.
- The hot slab continued to pass through the de‑scalar, roughing mill, stecket mill, down‑cooler, and finally the coils/sheets were stored in the coil yard.
- Then the CRM visit covered the entire cold‑rolling process for steel and the subsequent post‑processing of stainless steel.

## Day 4 (Sunday - Holiday)
- I used this day to document everything I saw and to record my running notes from the plant visit.

## Day 5
- It was the most exciting day of my internship. I was so curious about what they would teach me and in what way I was going to get industry exposure.
- While entering the C&IT dept block, I felt nervous, but anyway, I managed to remain calm.
- I was instructed to wait in the conference hall, which was silent. 
- A madam came to me and briefly explained what SSP does and the departments in SSP. She handed over a bunch of sheets, which were the "101" about C&IT, departments in SSP, and the specifications of the devices and servers they use.
- After a while, Annapurna Rao Sir came. The conference hall felt like an interview hall when he sat exactly straight before me at that round table.
- This made me experience what a one-on-one session would feel like.
- At the moment I was thinking about this, he started to ask questions about me, why I came for an internship at SSP, and what I had done in the first 4 days of my internship.
- Later, we discussed the plant visit, and he explained things even more clearly than the in-plant employees. I blended my observations with his words, which helped me understand things well.
- At one moment, he suddenly asked, "Okay Kabelan, why do we need a dept called C&IT?"
- Yeah, the question was simple and straight, but at that moment, I wasn't able to pinpoint the exact answer with all valid points. (I realized at that moment that even if you know the answer, you can't answer until or unless you understand it and know the framework to answer the questions).
- I gave reasons X, Y, and Z, but the answer he needed was a simple "A, B, C," which I failed to provide.
- Then he clearly explained in a well-detailed manner why an industry needs automation and a C&IT dept. 
- Then I answered the question using a random board I saw during the plant visit, which said "Smart Work -> Productivity -> Profit."
- He appreciated this answer, which brought our discussion to the next topic: the role of C&IT in increasing productivity and in other depts.
- Simply put, this discussion enabled me to experience the role of computers in the industry.
